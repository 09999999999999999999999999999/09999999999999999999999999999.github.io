    <h1>THE AGE OF BARBARISM</h1>

    <p>
      The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a new SARS-CoV virus (the first version of which caused the 2002–2004 outbreak),
      seemed to make clear for everyone the importance of global cooperation, solidarity and unity in our societies. It’s
      the common sense that suggests that during the state of emergency the humanity, at least for a while, has to combine
      its resources in order to save lives and save its dignity. Wouldn’t it be total madness if the governments would
      refuse to stop austerity policies when the health systems are overloaded; if the richests of the rich would keep
      pursuing immense profits while the rest of the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis; if the
      global community would fail to make any collective decision during a global emergency? Wouldn’t it bring our more or
      less civilized world into a state of some kind of barbarism? However, this is what happened. <br /><br />In this
      designer-as-an-author project I will try to outline some contours of this new predicament, which is, apparently, at
      its dawn.
